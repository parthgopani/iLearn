                                                    In the rest of this book, we will try to turn you into a person who is skilled in
                                                    the art of programming. In the end you will be a
    <span class="s5">programmer </span>- perhaps not a professional programmer, but at least you will have the skills to look at
                                                a data/information analysis problem and develop a program to solve the problem.
                                                </p>
                                            </div>
                                            <div class="card-body">
                                                <p>
                                                    In a sense, you need two skills to be a programmer:
                                                </p>
                                            </div>
                                            <div class="card-body">
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>First, you need to know the programming language (Python) - you need to know the
                                                        vocabulary and the grammar. You need to be able to spell the words in this new language
                                                        properly and know how to construct well-formed “sentences” in this new language.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>Second, you
                                                need to “tell a story”. In writing a story, you combine words and sentences to convey
                                                an idea to the reader. There is a skill and art in constructing the story, and skill
                                                in story writing is improved by doing some writing and getting some feedback. In
                                                programming, our program is the “story” and the problem you are trying to solve
                                                is the “idea”.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </div>

                                            <div class="card-body">
                                                <p>
                                                    Once you learn one programming language such as Python, you will find it much easier
                                                    to learn a second programming language such as JavaScript or C++. The new programming
                                                    language has very different vocabulary and grammar but the problem-solving skills
                                                    will be the same across all programming languages.
                                                </p>
                                            </div>
                                            <div class="card-body">
                                                <p>
                                                    You will learn the “vocabulary” and “sentences” of Python pretty quickly. It will
                                                    take longer for you to be able to write a coherent program to solve a brand-new
                                                    problem. We teach programming much like we teach writing. We start reading and explaining
                                                    programs, then we write simple programs, and then we write in- creasingly complex
                                                    programs over time. At some point you “get your muse” and see the patterns on your
                                                    own and can see more naturally how to take a problem and write a program that solves
                                                    that problem. And once you get to that point, programming becomes a very pleasant
                                                    and creative process.

                                                    We start with the vocabulary and structure of Python programs. Be patient as the
                                                    simple examples remind you of when you started reading for the first time.
