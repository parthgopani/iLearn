                                                through the rest of the book, don’t be afraid if the concepts don’t seem to fit
                                                together well the first time. When you were learning to speak, it was not a problem
                                                for your first few years that you just made cute gurgling noises. And it was OK
                                                if it took six months for you to move from simple vocabulary to simple sentences
                                                and took 5-6 more years to move from sentences to paragraphs, and a few more years
                                                to be able to write an interesting complete short story on your own.</p>

                                                We want you to learn Python much more rapidly, so we teach it all at the same time
                                                over the next few chapters. But it is like learning a new language that takes time
                                                to absorb and understand before it feels natural. That leads to some confusion as
                                                we visit and revisit topics to try to get you to see the big picture while we are
                                                defining the tiny fragments that make up that big picture. While the book is written
                                                linearly, and if you are taking a course it will progress in a linear fashion, don’t
                                                hesitate to be very nonlinear in how you approach the material. Look forwards and
                                                backwards and read with a light touch. By skimming more advanced material without
                                                fully understanding the details, you can get a better understanding of the “why?”
                                                of programming. By reviewing previous material and even redoing earlier exercises,
                                                you will realize that you actually learned a lot of material even if the material
                                                you are currently staring at seems a bit impenetrable.</p>
                                            <p style="padding-top: 6pt; padding-left: 51pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify;">
                                                Usually when you are learning your first programming language, there are a few wonderful
                                                “Ah Hah!” moments where you can look up from pounding away at some rock with a hammer
                                                and chisel and step away and see that you are indeed building a beautiful sculpture.
                                            </p>
                                            <p style="padding-top: 5pt; padding-left: 51pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify;">
                                                If something seems particularly hard, there is usually no value in staying up all
                                                night and staring at it. Take a break, take a nap, have a snack, explain what you
                                                are having a problem with to someone (or perhaps your dog), and then come back to
                                                it with fresh eyes. I assure you that once you learn the programming concepts in
                                                the book you will look back and see that it was all really easy and elegant and
                                                it simply took you a bit of time to absorb it.</p>
